Hackers can gain information through file transfer protocol, emails, tracking i.p. addresses, and uploading viruses to devices.
Grey hat hackers are between black and white hat hackers, so they work and are hired like white hat hackers but they also sometimes break laws and use unethical tactics and methods like black hat hackers.
They used the art of deception by convincing people and using social engineering to give them their information.
Personally identifable info includes d.o.b. , address, name, place of birth, ssn, biometric records, mother's maiden name, and phone number. basically anything that can easily identify a person.
I saw pop-ups, emails, and messages with suspicous links to yt videos and images. These phishing attempts tried to gain info or spread virues through my devices.
