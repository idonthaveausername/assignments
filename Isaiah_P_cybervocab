It was a partly cloudy sunday afternoon in a quiet suburb. There was a man going door to door trying to sell kitchen appliances. 
He then knocked on the door of large house probably about five bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms. A short silver haired elderly 
woman answered the door. The man could tell the woman was moving in so he introduced himself and she did the same. He then explained he
was selling kitchen equipment. The woman was interested so the man handed her a clipboard and she filled out the information sheet. After
about five minutes she handed it back. The man then said she can expect her kitchen equipment in 2-3 weeks. Little benounced to the woman
man was phising and just took her name, address, ss number, banking info, email account info, and her phone number. The would open bank
accounts, credit cards, and stole email acct.
